### Hey!

I'm Zac. I'm trying to learn how to write PICO-8 games!

Here is what I've made so far:

- [A pretty bad Asteroids clone](games/asteroids.html) (Just finished a better version that you can play [here](games/asteroids_v2.html))
- [A small runner-style game with vector graphics](games/vector.html)
